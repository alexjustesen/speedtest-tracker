## Code Style

### Laravel Pint

Always run `./vendor/bin/pint --dirty` after making any code changes to ensure code style consistency. This command formats only the files that have been modified according to the project's PHP coding standards.

**Usage:**
```bash
./vendor/bin/pint --dirty
```

This should be run before:
- Creating commits
- Opening pull requests
- Marking tasks as complete
