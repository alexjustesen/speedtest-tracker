### Why might I use this?

The main use case for Speedtest Tracker is to build a history of your internet's performance so that you can be informed when you're not receiving your ISP's advertised rates.

### What about that other Speedtest Tracker?

As far as I can tell https://github.com/henrywhitaker3/Speedtest-Tracker was abandoned. This is meant to be an actively maintained replacement with an improved UI and feature set.

## Getting Started

Speedtest Tracker is containerized so you can run it anywhere you run your Docker containers. The [install](https://docs.speedtest-tracker.dev/getting-started/installation) documentation will get you up and running with using Docker or Docker Composer along with choosing a database (SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB or Postgresql).

### Quick Start

#### Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name speedtest-tracker --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 8080:80 \
    -e PUID=1000 \
    -e PGID=1000 \
    -e APP_KEY= \ # How to generate an app key: https://speedtest-tracker.dev/
    -e APP_URL=http://localhost \
    -e DB_CONNECTION=sqlite \
    -v ${PWD}:/config \
    lscr.io/linuxserver/speedtest-tracker:latest
```

#### Docker Compose

```bash
services:
    speedtest-tracker:
        container_name: speedtest-tracker
        ports:
            - 8080:80
            - 8443:443
        environment:
            - PUID=1000
            - PGID=1000
            - APP_KEY= # How to generate an app key: https://speedtest-tracker.dev/
            - APP_URL=http://localhost
            - DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
        volumes:
            - /path/to/data:/config
            - /path/to-custom-ssl-keys:/config/keys
        image: lscr.io/linuxserver/speedtest-tracker:latest
