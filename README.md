### Why might I use this?

Speedtest Tracker's use case is to build a history of your internet's performance and uptime so that you can be informed when you're not receiving your ISP's advertised rates.

### What about that other Speedtest Tracker?

As far as I can tell https://github.com/henrywhitaker3/Speedtest-Tracker was abandoned. This is meant to be an actively maintained replacement with an improved UI and feature set.
