## Speedtest Tracker

### Introduction

Speedtest Tracker is a self-hosted internet performance tracking application that runs speedtest checks against Ookla's Speedtest service.

### Why might I use this?

The main use case for Speedtest Tracker is to build a history of your internet's performance so that you can be informed when you're not receiving your ISP's advertised rates.

#### What about that other Speedtest Tracker?

As far as I can tell https://github.com/henrywhitaker3/Speedtest-Tracker was abandoned. This version is meant to be an actively maintained replacement with an improved UI and feature set.

### Getting Started

Speedtest Tracker is containerized so you can run it anywhere you run your Docker containers. The [install](https://docs.speedtest-tracker.dev/getting-started/installation) documentation will get you up and running with using Docker or Docker Composer along with choosing a database (SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB or Postgresql).

#### FAQs and Features

[FAQs](https://docs.speedtest-tracker.dev/faqs) and a full list of planned and completed [features](https://docs.speedtest-tracker.dev/getting-started/features) can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.speedtest-tracker.dev).
